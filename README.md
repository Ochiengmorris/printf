# 0x11. C - printf

This is a _printf() function which imitates the actual printf() function. It was authored by Ochiengmorris and Ken-wangari. The both of us are students at ALX taking the Software engineering.

The _printf() function simply does the job of printing the formatted output and prints data.


Here is the prototype for the _printf function :
```c
int _printf("const char *format, ...");
```
Format has the string the string that is to be printed.

## Usage examples

```c
import foobar

# returns 'H'
_printf("H");

# returns 'Hello'
_printf("Hello");

# returns '20'
_printf("%d", 20);
```

To use tags just like the one used above, use the following prototype :
```c
%[flag][length,if any]specifier
```
